    "A business can only be as profitable as the products it sells hence the first arena of interested centered upon the what was generating the most revenues. To analyze this metric the Category table was concatenated with the Products table as well as the OrderDetail table. For the easy of understanding and conceptualization products were combined into similar categories as the number of unique products in correlation to the number of transactions would have been difficult to distill. Utilizing the Panda library functionality separate data frames of product categories was composited composing of all the transactions that had occurred. The new data frames were then re-sampled individually and equally to compare the average of the sampling to average sampling of the entire population of transactions. The two categories that stood out were Seafoods and Condiments being higher than the distribution of the entire set of products. "

    "To optimize revenues with the lowest possible cost the next hypothesis explored whether working on the weekends was optimal for sales. Simply put did the average weekday sale equal the average weekend sale? To determine whether it was advantageous to employ people over the weekend the OrderDetail table was joined to the Employees table through the Order table. This allowed to regroup every revenue generated to a given day of the week. As luck would have it the employees were given off or at least did not sell any goods on Thursday which evenly split the week into 2 sets of 3 days. "

    "The next area of interest was determining sales among countries and the variance between them. There was 175 entries in the SQL query joining the revenues of sales to the countries of origin through joining the OrderDetail table to the Customers table. Due to the large variety of number of sales as well as total revenues an average sale was implemented to keep countries on a level playing field. Individualized SQL queries per country were taken to allow for a simulation of 1000 future revenues that was based upon the average sampling of 50 events with replacement. France was chosen as the control for all other countries to be compared to for it possessed a median total revenue and average transaction rate. Of fourteen countries compared to the control only two were so different from the that the p-value was small enough to reject the null hypothesis of all countries being essentially equal to each other."

    "These four test have provided insights on how to further increase revenues for either future simulation through machine learning or implemented into direct practice by gently altering current models and further examining the results. While dissecting a business into discrete parts and investigating their relationships through hypothesis testing can be determined there are multiple layers that can affect the final outcome so care should be taken in a cautious approach."
